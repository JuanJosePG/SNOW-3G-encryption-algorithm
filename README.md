# SNOW-3G-encryption-algorithm

This is an implementation of the SNOW 3G encryption algorithm written in Python.
It consists of the core of my University's final project.

The objective of this project is to provide a tool that generates encryption sequences for the analysis and study of the parameters of the sequences.

SNOW 3G is a stream cipher algorithm oriented to 32 bits words based on PRNG over extended fields of Galois. The cipher has two parts, the LFSR is the linear part and the FSM provides the non-linear part.
